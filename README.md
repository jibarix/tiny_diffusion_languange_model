# Tiny Text Diffusion Model

**Masked diffusion language models that outperform autoregressive models in data-constrained settings**

This project implements the research findings from "Diffusion Beats Autoregressive in Data-Constrained Settings" (CMU, 2025), demonstrating that **masked diffusion models significantly outperform autoregressive models when training on limited data with repeated epochs**. 

Unlike traditional language models that process text left-to-right, this implementation uses **masked diffusion** with random token orderings, providing implicit data augmentation that leads to superior performance when data—not compute—is the bottleneck.

## 🔬 Research Foundation

**Key Finding**: While autoregressive models excel with abundant unique data, diffusion models achieve **67% loss reduction** vs 48% for AR models when training on repeated data, continuing to improve for up to **500 epochs** vs only 15 for AR models.

**Why This Matters**: With high-quality text data projected to be exhausted by 2028, learning efficiently from limited data becomes critical. This project provides a practical framework for training effective language models on single books or small corpora.

**Technical Innovation**: 3-stage curriculum learning combined with masked diffusion, where the model learns from diverse token prediction tasks rather than fixed left-to-right ordering.

### Data Preparation

#### Supported Text Formats
- Plain text files (.txt) 
- UTF-8 encoding required
- Any literary work or coherent text corpus
- Minimum ~50KB text recommended for meaningful curriculum

#### Text Requirements
```bash
# Acceptable input files:
data/raw/frankenstein.txt        # Classic literature
data/raw/darwin_origin.txt       # Scientific text  
data/raw/custom_corpus.txt       # Any coherent text

# The system handles:
# - Automatic sentence segmentation
# - Vocabulary compression (reduces 50K+ words to ~25K tokens)

```

#### Automatic Processing Pipeline
The training script automatically handles all data preparation:

1. **Text Segmentation**: Sentences split using NLTK + spaCy
2. **Difficulty Scoring**: 
   - Lexical rarity (IDF-based vocabulary complexity)
   - Syntactic complexity (readability metrics)
   - Thematic centrality (sentence embedding clusters)
3. **Compressed Tokenizer**: Custom vocabulary from your text
4. **Curriculum Construction**: Easy→Medium→Hard progression

```bash
# No separate data prep needed - training handles everything:
python scripts/train.py --book data/raw/your_text.txt
```

#### Manual Data Preparation (Optional)
```bash
# If you want to inspect data preparation separately:
python scripts/prepare_data.py --book data/raw/frankenstein.txt --output data/processed/

# This creates:
# - data/processed/segments.pkl (scored text segments)
# - data/processed/curriculum_splits.pkl (3-stage curriculum)
# - data/processed/compressed_tokenizer.json (custom vocab)
# - data/processed/statistics.json (dataset stats)
```

### Training
```bash
# Quick debug training (1 epoch per stage)
python scripts/train.py --book data/raw/frankenstein.txt --debug

# Full training with 3-stage curriculum
python scripts/train.py --book data/raw/frankenstein.txt

# Memory-efficient training for limited VRAM
python scripts/train.py --book data/raw/frankenstein.txt --memory-efficient
```

python scripts/generate.py --checkpoint outputs/best_model.pt --interactive

# Generate with custom parameters
python scripts/generate.py --checkpoint outputs/best_model.pt --temperature 0.8 --prompt "Science"
```

## 🧠 Learning Methodology

### Scientific Foundation: Data Efficiency Through Curriculum + Diffusion

**Core Innovation**: Combines masked diffusion (random token ordering) with curriculum learning to achieve 16x better data efficiency than autoregressive models in data-constrained settings.

**Research Evidence**: 
- **R*_D = 512** for diffusion vs **R*_D = 31** for AR (epochs before diminishing returns)
- Diffusion continues improving for **100+ epochs**, AR saturates at **4 epochs**
- **Critical compute threshold**: C_crit(U) ∝ U^2.174 determines when diffusion outperforms AR

### 3-Stage Curriculum Learning

Progressive difficulty training leveraging diffusion's superior data reuse capability:

#### Stage I: Foundational Learning (50 epochs)
**Goal**: Establish basic language patterns and core vocabulary

- **Masking Rate**: 75-90% (heavy masking forces focus on fundamentals)
- **Data Selection**: 
  - Bottom 33% syntactic complexity (simple sentences)
  - Bottom 33% lexical rarity (common vocabulary)
  - Top 33% thematic centrality (prototypical examples)
- **Format**: Individual sentences (10-50 words)
- **Learning Focus**: 
  - Basic grammar and syntax
  - Common word patterns
  - Central themes and concepts
  - Foundational vocabulary relationships

**Example Frankenstein segments in Stage I**:
```
"I was benevolent and good; misery made me a fiend."
"The winter has been dreadfully severe."
"Nothing is more painful to the human mind than anxiety."
```

#### Stage II: Structural Learning (100 epochs)
**Goal**: Learn argumentative relationships and logical flow

- **Masking Rate**: 40-60% (moderate masking for structural learning)
- **Data Selection**:
  - Bottom 66% syntactic complexity (easy to moderate)
  - Logical argument components (evidence, claims, warrants)
  - Sentence pairs for relationship learning
- **Format**: Sentence pairs connected with [SEP] tokens
- **Learning Focus**:
  - Cause-effect relationships
  - Argumentative structure
  - Narrative progression
  - Character interactions
  - Thematic development

**Example Frankenstein pairs in Stage II**:
```
"I had worked hard for nearly two years. [SEP] The beauty of the dream vanished."
"Nothing is so painful to the human mind as uncertainty. [SEP] I resolved to visit some remote spot."
```

#### Stage III: Refinement (150 epochs)
**Goal**: Master full complexity and generate coherent passages

- **Masking Rate**: 10-30% (light masking for fine-tuning)
- **Data Selection**: Full corpus including outliers and complex examples
- **Format**: Multi-sentence paragraphs (up to 200 words)
- **Learning Focus**:
  - Long-range dependencies
  - Complex narrative structures
  - Stylistic consistency
  - Sophisticated vocabulary usage
  - Genre-specific patterns

**Example Frankenstein paragraphs in Stage III**:
```
"It was on a dreary night of November that I beheld the accomplishment of my toils. 
With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I collected the instruments of life 
around me, that I might infuse a spark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet."
```

### Why Diffusion Beats Autoregressive in Data-Constrained Settings

**Implicit Data Augmentation**: Masked diffusion exposes models to diverse token orderings and prediction tasks during training, unlike AR's fixed left-to-right factorization. This acts like data augmentation, similar to random cropping in computer vision.

**Mathematical Evidence**:
- **AR factorization**: p(x) = p(x₀)p(x₁|x₀)p(x₂|x₁,x₀)... (fixed order)
- **Diffusion factorization**: p(x) = p(x₂|x₃)p(x₃|x₀)p(x₀|x₁)p(x₁) (random order)

**Scaling Law Discovery**: 
```
D′ = U + U·R*_D(1 - e^(-(E-1)/R*_D))
where R*_D = 512 for diffusion vs 31 for AR
```

This means diffusion extracts **16x more value** from repeated data before hitting diminishing returns.

### Progressive Masking Strategy

**Theoretical Foundation**: Masking rate decreases across stages to match learning progression, leveraging diffusion's superior ability to learn from repeated data:

```
Stage I:   ████████████████░░░░  75-90% masked (heavy masking for fundamentals)
Stage II:  ████████░░░░░░░░░░░░  40-60% masked (moderate for relationships)  
Stage III: ███░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  10-30% masked (light for fine-tuning)
```

**Research Validation**: This progression allows models to extract maximum value from repeated exposures. AR models overfit after ~4 epochs, while diffusion benefits from 100+ epochs on the same data.

### Difficulty Scoring System

Multi-dimensional scoring leveraging diffusion's robustness to repeated data:

#### 1. Lexical Difficulty (30% weight)
- **Method**: IDF-based rarity scoring against reference corpus
- **Range**: Common words (low) → Rare terms (high)

#### 2. Syntactic Difficulty (40% weight)
- **Features**: Sentence length, subordinate clauses, Flesch-Kincaid grade, parse tree depth
- **Range**: Simple sentences (low) → Complex syntax (high)

#### 3. Thematic Centrality (30% weight)
- **Method**: K-means clustering of sentence embeddings
- **Range**: Outlier concepts (low) → Core themes (high)

### Learning Progression Indicators

Monitor these metrics to track curriculum effectiveness:

#### Stage I Success Metrics:
- Loss drops rapidly (>50% reduction in first 20 epochs)
- Perplexity decreases to <15
- Generated text shows basic grammar
- Model learns common word patterns

#### Stage II Success Metrics:
- Steady loss improvement (gradual decline)
- Model generates logical sentence pairs
- Improved coherence in multi-sentence text
- Better handling of narrative transitions

#### Stage III Success Metrics:
- Loss plateau with occasional improvements
- Generated paragraphs maintain thematic consistency
- Style matches source text characteristics
- Long-range dependencies preserved
