# Tiny Text Diffusion Model: Single-Book Style Generator

## Project Overview

A comprehensive exploration of training a small masked diffusion language model on any single book using consumer hardware. This project implements cutting-edge curriculum learning and training strategies to maximize performance in data-constrained settings, based on state-of-the-art research.

### Key Research Insights  
- **Diffusion beats autoregressive in data-constrained settings**: When data is limited but compute is abundant, masked diffusion models significantly outperform AR models by making better use of repeated data (Prabhudesai et al., 2025).  
- **Critical compute threshold**: Diffusion becomes the favorable approach when the training compute exceeds a specific threshold, which can be calculated for a given dataset size.  
- **Superior data reuse**: Diffusion models can benefit from training on repeated data for up to **~500 effective epochs**, whereas AR models begin to overfit and see diminishing returns after only ~15 epochs.  
- **MDLM objective**: The state-of-the-art training objective simplifies to a weighted mixture of MLM losses, enabling stable training and efficient generation (Sahoo et al., 2024).

## Understanding the Critical Compute Threshold

### What Does the Formula Mean?

The core finding from Prabhudesai et al. (2025, Section 4.3) is a formula that tells us **when diffusion models become better than autoregressive models**:

`Ccrit(U) = 2.12 × 10^15 · U^2.174`

- **U** = Amount of unique text data (in tokens)  
- **C** = Computing power used (in FLOPs - floating point operations)

### Real-World Translation

**The Bottom Line**: If you have a fixed, limited amount of text but can afford to train for a long time, diffusion models will eventually produce better results than traditional models once your total compute crosses this threshold.

**Example Scenarios**:  
- **Small dataset (1M tokens)**: Need ~2.12 × 10^21 FLOPs for diffusion to outperform AR.  
- **Medium dataset (100M tokens)**: Need ~3.56 × 10^24 FLOPs.

### Why This Matters for Our Project

**Single Book Training**: A typical book contains 100K-500K tokens. According to the formula, the critical compute threshold is well within reach of a consumer GPU running for several days or weeks.

**Practical Insight**: The paper's findings provide strong empirical validation for this project's entire premise: using a diffusion model for single-book style generation is the optimal strategy for operating in the "data-constrained, compute-abundant" regime.

**Key Takeaway**: Autoregressive models learn fast but hit a ceiling quickly when data is repeated. Diffusion models learn more slowly but continue to improve and extract more value from the same data over hundreds of epochs.

## Three-Stage Curriculum Learning (3S-CL) Framework

### Research Foundation

Our curriculum learning approach builds on established research in multi-stage training for small language models and adapts it specifically for masked diffusion objectives:

**Multi-Stage Structure**: The sequential three-stage design follows Yamani et al. (2024), who demonstrated that multi-stage curricula with optimizer resets significantly improve small model performance on complex compositional tasks. This approach is reinforced by Anonymous (2025), showing hierarchical progression from basic narrative elements to refined coherence in creative text generation.

**Difficulty Metrics Integration**: Each stage employs different difficulty criteria:

- **Lexical & Syntactic Complexity** (Stage I): Based on Platanios et al. (2019), using sentence length and vocabulary rarity as data-intrinsic difficulty measures
- **Thematic Centrality** (Stage I): Implements the "cluster curriculum" from Zhao et al. (2020), prioritizing prototypical examples within thematic clusters before introducing outliers
- **Argumentative Structure** (Stage II): Adapts Toulmin's argumentation model (Qin & Uccelli, 2018; Tiryaki, 2018) to teach logical relationships through Evidence→Claim pairs

**Diffusion-Specific Adaptation**: The masking rate progression directly implements Kim et al. (2024), who resolved that for diffusion models, lower noise (fewer masks) represents harder tasks. Our "easy-to-hard" curriculum decreases masking rates across stages (75-90% → 40-60% → 5-20%).

**Self-Training Enhancement**: Stage III incorporates Curriculum-Based Self-Training from Chen et al. (2022), using the Stage II model to generate pseudo-labeled data for handling the most complex examples in low-data settings.

### Three-Stage Implementation

#### Stage I: Foundational (75 epochs)
- **Objective**: Learn core vocabulary and basic sentence structures
- **Data Selection**: High-centrality, low-complexity sentences (bottom 33% syntactic complexity)
- **Masking Rate**: 75-90% (high difficulty for diffusion)
- **Training Format**: Individual sentences with length filtering

#### Stage II: Structural (150 epochs)
- **Objective**: Learn argumentative relationships and logical flow
- **Data Selection**: Evidence-claim pairs with moderate complexity
- **Masking Rate**: 40-60% (medium difficulty)
- **Training Format**: Structured pairs `<Evidence> [SEP] <Claim>`

#### Stage III: Refinement (300 epochs)
- **Objective**: Master full complexity and generate coherent passages
- **Data Selection**: Full corpus including complex sentences and outliers
- **Masking Rate**: 5-20% (low difficulty, hardest reconstruction)
- **Training Format**: Full paragraphs (up to 512 tokens) with self-training

### Academic Validation

This framework specifically addresses the data-constrained setting where diffusion models excel over autoregressive approaches, as validated by Prabhudesai et al. (2025). The curriculum progression aligns with the critical compute threshold theory, maximizing learning efficiency when data is limited but compute is abundant.

### Key Innovations

- **Hybrid Difficulty Scoring**: Combines lexical, syntactic, and thematic centrality metrics
- **Diffusion-Optimized Progression**: Masking rate decreases to increase reconstruction difficulty
- **Argument-Aware Training**: Teaches logical relationships through structured pairs
- **Self-Training Integration**: Generates pseudo-data for complex examples in final stage

## Training Strategy: Advanced MDLM Framework

### MDLM Training Objective

Our project implements the state-of-the-art **Masked Diffusion Language Model (MDLM)** objective from Sahoo et al. (2024), which has been proven to significantly outperform previous diffusion approaches:

#### Core MDLM Objective
The MDLM objective is elegantly simple: a **weighted mixture of MLM losses** with random masking rates:

```python
def mdlm_loss(self, input_ids, attention_mask):
    # Sample random timestep t (masking rate) for each sequence
    t = torch.rand(batch_size, device=device)
    
    # Create masked input based on timestep
    masked_input_ids = self.apply_masking(input_ids, t)
    
    # Forward pass on masked input
    logits = self.forward(masked_input_ids, attention_mask)
    
    # Weighted cross-entropy loss
    loss = self.weighted_cross_entropy(logits, input_ids, t)
    return loss
```

#### Semi-Autoregressive (SAR) Generation
The MDLM framework supports efficient **Semi-Autoregressive sampling** for generating arbitrary-length text:

- **Block-wise Generation**: Generate text in blocks rather than token-by-token
- **25-30x Speedup**: Dramatically faster than traditional autoregressive generation
- **Flexible Length**: Can generate sequences of any target length
- **Quality Preservation**: Maintains generation quality while improving speed

### Three-Stage Curriculum Learning with MDLM
